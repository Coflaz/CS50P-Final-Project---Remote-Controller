## Getting Started

To use the TV remote controller, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this project to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the `project.py` file using Python: `python project.py`.
5. Interact with the user interface to explore the various functionalities of the TV remote controller.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `project.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `RemoteController` class, which represents the TV remote controller. It also includes a `main()` function that provides a user-friendly interface.
- `test_project.py`: This file contains a set of unit tests to verify the correctness of the `RemoteController` class.

## Usage

Once you launch the `project.py` file, you'll be presented with a menu that lists the available options. Simply input the corresponding number to perform a specific action. Feel free to navigate through the menu and experiment with different features!

## Testing

To ensure the reliability of the TV remote controller, we've included a set of unit tests in the `test_project.py` file. These tests cover various functionalities and can be run using a testing framework such as `pytest`. Execute the tests to verify the correctness of the implemented features.

We hope you enjoy using the TV remote controller project! Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code according to your needs.
